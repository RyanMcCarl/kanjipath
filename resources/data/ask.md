# Next
⿱艹⿻口龶 left half of 勤?

# HIGH
Like 𧘇 but *without* the hook on second stroke, as in 園?

top of 留? ⿰𠂎刀 could work but is there an alternative without the long tail of 𠂎?

left hand side of 在? Rather than ⿻𠂇丨

無 without 灬, rather than 𠂉卌一?

The top-left component in 鹿 and 慶?

The left component in 帅, which is {49} in IDS.TXT?

㥑 minus 心? IDS.TXT has "?" for this component. ⿱⿲一丿月冖 seems too much?

# LOW
电 without the tidbit sticking up per 竜?

寿 minus 寸. Is there something more curved that 丰?

翟 where the top components have straight lines like 彐 instead of 习? Per 濯. 


肀? per 唐, is there one that is not long? But also in 庸 which is long.

# IDS capable
